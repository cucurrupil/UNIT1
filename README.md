# Algorithm
 
 An algorithm is a set of instructions designed to perform a specific task. This can be a simple process, such as multiplying two numbers, or a complex operation, such as playing a compressed video file.
 
 
# Algorithm representation

* Graphic

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

* Pseudocode

Pseudocode is an informal way of programming description that does not require any strict programming language syntax or underlying technology considerations. It is used for creating an outline or a rough draft of a program.

# Variable

Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in a computer program, the variable must be in the left side of the assignation.


``` javascript
int x;
x = x+3;
x++;​​​​
```

# Constant
A constant is a value that cannot be altered by the program during normal execution

```javascript
int m;
m=72;
```
# Type of computational data

Programming uses a number of different data types. A data type determines what type of value an object can have and what operations can be performed. 

* STRING

One of the most widely used data types is a string. A string consists of one or more characters, which can include letters, numbers, and other types of characters. You can think of a string as plain text.

A string represents alphanumeric data.
```c++
char m;
m = "Adios mundo";
``` 

*  NUMERICAL

The second most important data type is numeric data. 

There are several different ones.
An integer is a numeric value without a decimal.
```c++
int x
float s
x = 3;
float = 3.9;
``` 

A number with a decimal is referred to as a decimal, a float or a double. The terminology varies somewhat with the programming language being used. 

* BOOLEAN

 Computer science, a Boolean expression is an expression used in programming languages that produces a Boolean value when evaluated. A Boolean value is either true or false.
```c++
bool isCodingFun = true;
```

* ARRAY

In computer science, array programming refers to solutions which allow the application of operations to an entire set of values at once. A simple example will be the use of for function.

# Structure types


* Repetitive structures

```c++
for (x = 1; x = 50 ; x ++)
{
m = m+1;
}

```

* Selective structures

Selection structures are used to perform 'decision making' and then branch the program flow based on the outcome of decision making.

```c++
if (house = near)
{
running = stop_running;
}
else
{
running = run;
}
```

* Nested structures

Nested structure in C is nothing but structure within structure. One structure can be declared inside other structure as we declare structure members inside a structure.

```c++
if (x < y)
{
for (x = 1; x > y ; x ++)
{

}
}
```
